We introduce **LLaVA-VLA**, an open-source Vision-Language-Action model built upon the popular open-source VLM [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). This implementation combines accessibility with strong performance for robotic manipulation tasks. The key features lie in:

1. üèóÔ∏è **Minimalist design** - It is a vanilla VLA architecture without performance-hacking components. It is designed for easy modification and educational use. And it is also an ideal baseline for new researchers in embodied AI.
2. üèÜ **Competitive performance** - It achieves 3.68% success rate on [CALVIN](https://github.com/mees/calvin) benchmark, which outperforms the most popular baseline OpenVLA.
3. üí∏ **Efficient training** - It does not need pre-training on large-scale robot datasets. It only requires 7h fine-tuning from the LLaVA-v1.5-7b checkpoint.
4. üîå **Seamless Extensibility** - It is built on the widely-used LLaVA ecosystem. It fosters easy technology transfer to derivative projects.
5. üîÑ **Active maintenance** - We will continuously improve it with new functions and environments.

## üìä Overview
![Model Architecture](./images/LLaVA_pipline2.png)
The network architecture of our LLaVA-VLA. Given images, proprioception and language instructions, our method first tokenizes the input and then feeds the results into the LLM. The LLM outputs an action chunking, which are finally detokenized into valid action values and deployed on the mechanical arm.

<a id="experimental-results"></a>
LLaVA-VLA has a competitive performance on the CALVIN ABC‚û°D tasks. With the simple structure, it outperforms several popular strong baselines that rely on large-scale pre-training and complex structures.

<a id="key-design"></a>
## ‚≠ê Key Designs
1.	Concatenated Multi-view Images:
In manipulation tasks, third-person view images often provide global contextual information, while first-person view images offer precise object-to-gripper positional cues, which are crucial for achieving high-precision manipulation. Therefore, incorporating both perspectives is essential. Several strategies exist for handling multi-view inputs. Encoding each image separately and then concatenating their tokens typically leads to an excessive number of image tokens and introduces considerable redundancy, resulting in suboptimal performance. This phenomenon is also observed in [RoboVLM](https://github.com/Robot-VLAs/RoboVLMs). One potential remedy is to apply a Perceiver Resampler to reduce visual token count; however, this approach may incur information loss, which our empirical results confirmed through poor performance. Consequently, we adopt a simpler yet effective strategy: vertically concatenating the first- and third-person view images into a single composite image. This approach not only reduces the number of tokens while preserving complete multi-view visual information, but also aligns with the training paradigm of LLaVA, thereby avoiding potential performance degradation.
2.	Proprioception as Input:
Proprioceptive information is critical for enabling robots to infer their current state and maintain action continuity. A common approach is to extract this information using an MLP. In our design, we encode proprioception directly into the same embedding space as the action tokens via an action tokenizer. This integration facilitates better exploitation of the VLM‚Äôs language modeling capabilities for understanding and generating coherent actions.
3.	Action Chunking:
Action chunking plays a pivotal role in manipulation tasks. Training the vision-language-action (VLA) model to predict action chunks implicitly endows it with planning capabilities and improves the temporal coherence of the generated actions. In our implementation, we set the action chunking size to 5.

## üíæ Installation
### Dependencies
#### Python versions: Python 3.8+
#### Operating systems: Linux: Ubuntu 18.04+
#### Software: CUDA Version: 12.1

### Basic Env
1. Clone this repository and navigate to LLaVA folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA.git
cd LLaVA
conda create -n llava python=3.10 -y
conda activate llava
pip install --upgrade pip  
pip install -e .
```
### Dataset
2. Clone and install CALVIN
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mees/calvin.git
export CALVIN_ROOT=$(pwd)/calvin
cd $CALVIN_ROOT
conda create -n calvin_venv python=3.8  
conda activate calvin_venv

3. Download CALVIN dataset
```bash
cd $CALVIN_ROOT/dataset
sh download_data.sh ABC
```
Please note that the `numpy` version = 1.23.5!

4. Preprocess CALVIN dataset. This step will output a JSON file formatted for VLA training and a processed folder containing stitched images. You can manually modify the save path, but please ensure to use the data from the correct path during training/testing.
```bash
cd LLaVA-VLA
python ./scripts/helper/calvin2json.py
```

## üìà Training
LLaVA-VLA is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory. To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the per_device_train_batch_size and increase the gradient_accumulation_steps accordingly. If you want to train from the checkpoint, always keep the global batch size the same: per_device_train_batch_size x gradient_accumulation_steps x num_gpus.
If you have multiple GPUs and wish to use PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel, simply set the number in the command below to match the number of available GPUs(CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES and localhost).
```bash
cd LLaVA-VLA
bash ./scripts/train/calvin_finetune_obs.sh
